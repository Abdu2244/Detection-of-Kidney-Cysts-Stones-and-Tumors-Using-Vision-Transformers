Project Description
The goal of this project is to implement and explore Vision Transformer models for the automatic detection of kidney cysts, stones, and tumors from CT radiographic images. Using "Vision transformer and explainable transfer learning models for auto-detection of kidney cyst, stone, and tumor from CT radiography" (Md Nazmul Islam et al., 2022) . The primary objective is to achieve high accuracy in multi-class classification, we will make use of pre-trained transformer models like compact convolutional transformers also known for CCT tasks, and/or improve interpretability through Grad CAM visualizations, which reveal critical regions influencing the model's predictions.
The CT Kidney Dataset, annotated and publicly available on Kaggle, will be used for training and evaluation. This dataset contains 12 thousand labeled images of kidney cysts, stones, tumors, and normal findings. The paper will be aimed to be replicated and then improved upon.
